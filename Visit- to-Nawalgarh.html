              Chairperson’s Visit to Nawalgarh: Support to Farmers and Women SHGs Strengthened
            </h4>

            <!-- Event Description -->
            <p class="p-0">
              The Chairperson of Morarka Foundation, Smt. Bharti Morarka, along with Mrs. Pragati Mundhra,
              visited Nawalgarh and interacted with local farmers and Self-Help Group (SHG) women. Their
              gracious presence and active engagement made the two-day visit truly impactful and enriching
              for the entire community.
            </p>

            <p class="p-0">
              During the programme, spray machines were distributed to farmers to enhance agricultural
              efficiency. Additionally, financial assistance of ₹88 lakh was provided to 40 SHG women by
              Chairperson Ma'am & NABARD, enabling them to strengthen their livelihood activities and expand
              income-generating opportunities.
            </p>

            <p class="p-0">
              The Chairperson encouraged farmers to adopt organic and sustainable farming practices to
              improve soil health, reduce input costs, and enhance the quality of life for both land and
              community. Farmers were motivated to move toward chemical-free cultivation for long-term
              ecological and economic benefits.
            </p>

            <p class="p-0">
              The event also featured discussions on various government and NABARD-supported schemes aimed
              at empowering rural communities, promoting sustainable agriculture, and fostering women’s
              entrepreneurship.
            </p>

            <p class="p-0">
              However, the key highlight of the programme was the interaction between traditional farmers
              and new-age farmers, who are keen to carry forward their agricultural legacy while embracing
              modern practices. This exchange of experiences fostered learning, innovation, and motivation
              among the participants.
            </p>

            <p class="p-1">
              The programme concluded with an assurance of continued support and collaboration for the holistic
              development of farmers and SHG groups in the region.
