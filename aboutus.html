                <p class="p-2">
                  Born in a traditional Marwari family, Kamal Morarka, India's leading industrialist
                  and philanthropist, registered M.R. Morarka-GDC Rural Research Foundation in 1991
                  in memory of his father Late M.R. Morarka. The farsightedness, clarity of vision,
                  thought, and sound technical knowledge of the founders gave the Foundation a humble
                  but firm beginning in 1994.
                </p>

                <p class="p-2">
                  Unlike most voluntary organizations, the Morarka Foundation’s engagement extends far beyond conventional social welfare and charitable activities. The Foundation has been a pioneer in initiating and advancing diverse development domains in India, including organic farming and certification, agricultural extension services, tourism promotion, waste management, vermicomposting, and the conservation of heritage sites.
                </p>

                <p class="p-2">
                  To reinforce its extension initiatives aimed at sustainable wealth creation for society, the Morarka Foundation has consistently placed strong emphasis on research and development in appropriate technologies. Its R&D journey began in 1995 with the recycling of farm waste using both traditional and modern approaches, with a focused thrust on the development and promotion of vermiculture technology. By the year 2000, the Foundation had emerged as the country’s single largest producer of vermicompost.
                </p>

                <p class="p-2">
                  Development and promotion of Organic Agriculture began with 10,000 farm families from
                  Nawalgarh in Rajasthan; today, the existing program is spread over 15 states in India,
                  covering over 250,000 farm families. Every month, over 10,000 farm families are being added
                  to make this initiative the single largest organic agriculture development and support program
                  in the world.
                </p>

                <p class="p-2">
                  To convert agriculture into agribusinesses, Information Technology applications in
                  agriculture have been identified as a thrust area. IT platforms have been developed
                  to deliver Knowledge Management Services through integrated information and communication
                  technology tools.
                </p>

                <p class="p-2">
                  Tourism promotion in the Shekhawati region was identified as a strategic opportunity for fostering ethnic integration while generating employment for rural youth. With the launch of the first Shekhawati Festival in 1995, the initiative has since evolved into an event of national recognition, known for showcasing organic farms and food festivals and for bringing together communities from various villages across Rajasthan.
                </p>

                <p class="">
                  The initiatives to document the cultural heritage of Shekhawati, a major restoration
                  and conservation effort, have been ongoing for the last decade. Today, it has become
                  a model of Heritage Conservation in India.
                </p>

                <p  class="p-2">
                  Additionally, many more initiatives such as Watershed Development, Sheep and Wool
                  Development, Skill Development for Diamond Cutting and Polishing, Eradication of Child
                  Labour, Alternate Health & Family Welfare Services, Literacy & Primary Education,
                  Food and Nutrition programs have also been successfully implemented.

                  The journey that began in 1993–94 from Nawalgarh, a small town located on the edge
                  of the Thar Desert in Rajasthan, now serves over one million households through
                  Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES).
