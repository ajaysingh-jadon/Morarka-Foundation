          <div class="founder-sub">Founder • Morarka Foundation</div>

          <p>
            Morarka Organic traces its roots to the Morarka Foundation and the Morarka family. Its chairman
            Mr. Kamal Morarka firmly believes that more than resources, it is the resource management capabilities
            of the rural poor that needs immediate intervention. Intrinsically woven into India's tradition and culture,
            philanthropy has perpetuated itself down the ages and lives on even today. Mr. Kamal Morarka, a leading
            industrialist born in a traditional Marwari family, is striving to create social capital. An industrialist,
            politician and social worker, Mr. Morarka has many facets to him.
          </p>

          <p>
            His initiatives, with the M.R.Morarka GDC Rural Research Foundation, have been able to make a
            difference in the lives of villagers from one of the most backward areas of Rajasthan. Although
            Mr. Morarka was born and brought up in Mumbai, he visited Shekhawati quite often in his childhood.
            It was the seat of all religious ceremonies in the family. The backwardness of the region in stark
            contrast with the dynamism of Mumbai, was a reality check. Thus his activities in Shekhawati along
            with the Morarka Foundation, is his way of giving back to his roots.
          </p>

          <p>
            In essence, Mr. Kamal Morarka and the Morarka Foundation's activities are directed extensively towards
            social concerns. The effort is towards creating sustainable and economically balanced solutions for rural
            communities. Morarka Organic keeps this philosophy in mind and works for a better tomorrow by bringing
            about a change, today.
          </p>

          <h4 class="section-heading">The Torchbearer</h4>

          <p>
            M R Morarka passed away on October 19, 1987. A few years later, in memory of his father, Kamal Morarka
            founded the M R Morarka-GDC Rural Research Foundation in Nawalgarh which has grown over the decades to
            serve innumerable households. The foundation engages in rural development work covering hundreds of villages
            in the Shekhawati region. Apart from pioneering organic farming, it has a host of other initiatives to its
            credit that include vermiculture, natural resources management, microfinance, value added employment,
            promotion of tourism, disaster management, etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            Memories of departed near and dear ones stay forever, and it’s been the same with Kamal Morarka too, who
            finds his father’s humility, values and ability to bring about a turnaround in the family's fortunes
            immensely inspiring. Apart from being a successful industrialist and a well-known political leader,
            Kamal Morarka has many achievements to his credit.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through two decades, Morarka Organic—one of the <strong class="text-success">top ten organic food producing companies</strong> in the world—is
            backed by the relentless work of its team and Morarka’s guidance as an agricultural expert and advisor to the
            Government of India. His vision of sustainable agricultural development is widely applauded as he has enabled
            connections with over <strong class="text-success">2,50,000 farmers</strong> and mentored more than <strong class="text-success">10,000 startups</strong>. Under his leadership, Morarka
            Organic manages over <strong class="text-success">5 lakh acres of land</strong> under organic cultivation.
