            <p class="muted-text">
              The Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) is a Government of India initiative aimed at promoting certified organic farming, strengthening value chains, and improving market access across the North Eastern states. The programme focuses on farmer mobilization, capacity-building, cluster development, organic input support, ICS strengthening, certification under NPOP, and development of processing and marketing infrastructure.
            </p>

            <p class="muted-text">
              The initiative supports the development of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) and crop-specific organic production clusters by providing necessary infrastructural, technical, and financial support. It facilitates partnerships between farmers and organic businesses, including local enterprises and/or FPOs, through back-to-back long-term trade relations with domestic and export clients. The programme also creates an enabling environment for project initiatives and development programs, promoting organic value chain development and ensuring market access for farmers.

          <h2>Key objectives and interventions of the programme include:</h2>

          <ol class="muted-text">
            <li>Empowering producers with program ownership by organizing them into Farmer Interest Groups (FIGs), with the ultimate aim of federating them into Farmer Producer Organizations/Companies.</li>
            <li>Transitioning from conventional or subsistence farming to local resource-based, self-sustainable, high-value commercial organic enterprises.</li>
            <li>Providing training and ongoing support at farmer, FIG, and FPO levels to enhance the quality and productivity of organic produce while facilitating access to premium markets.</li>
            <li>Developing commodity-specific commercial organic value chains through an integrated and concentrated approach with end-to-end facilities for production, processing, storage, and marketing.</li>
            <li>Creating organic parks or zones equipped with facilities for collection, aggregation, value addition, processing, storage, and market linkages, particularly for commodities requiring high-end technological investment.</li>
            <li>Building and promoting NER products as branded labels, facilitating stronger marketing access under the ownership of growers’ organizations or companies.</li>
            <li>Establishing state-specific lead agencies such as an Organic Commodity Board or Organic Mission to coordinate, monitor, support, and finance the development and operationalization of the entire organic value chain.</li>
