                <p class="p-2">
                  Born in a traditional Marwari family, Kamal Morarka, India's leading industrialist
                  and philanthropist, registered M.R. Morarka-GDC Rural Research Foundation in 1991
                  in memory of his father Late M.R. Morarka. The farsightedness, clarity of vision,
                  thought, and sound technical knowledge of the founders gave the Foundation a humble
                  but firm beginning in 1994.
                </p>

                <p class="p-2">
                  Unlike other voluntary organizations, Morarka Foundation is into more than just the
                  conventional areas of voluntary actions. We have often taken the lead to venture into
                  new areas such as Organic Farming and Certifications, Agriculture Extension, Tourism
                  Promotion, Waste Management, Vermi Compost, and Conservation of Heritage Sites.
                </p>

                <p class="p-2">
                  To supplement and strengthen extension efforts for creating wealth for society,
                  Morarka Foundation has always laid special emphasis on R&D for technology. Beginning
                  with recycling of farm waste through traditional and modern methods, in 1995 it focused
                  its efforts on the development and promotion of Vermiculture Technology. By the year
                  2000, Morarka Foundation had become the single largest producer of Vermicast in the world.
                </p>

                <p class="p-2">
                  Development and promotion of Organic Agriculture began with 10,000 farm families from
                  Nawalgarh in Rajasthan; today, the existing program is spread over 15 states in India,
                  covering over 250,000 farm families. Every month, over 10,000 farm families are being added
                  to make this initiative the single largest organic agriculture development and support program
                  in the world.
                </p>

                <p class="p-2">
                  To convert agriculture into agribusinesses, Information Technology applications in
                  agriculture have been identified as a thrust area. IT platforms have been developed
                  to deliver Knowledge Management Services through integrated information and communication
                  technology tools.
                </p>

                <p class="p-2">
                  Tourism Promotion in Shekhawati was identified as an opportunity for creating
                  employment for rural youth. Beginning with the first Shekhawati Festival in 1995,
                  today this event is recognized across the country for Organic Farms and Food Festivals.
                </p>

                <p class="">
                  The initiatives to document the cultural heritage of Shekhawati, a major restoration
                  and conservation effort, have been ongoing for the last decade. Today, it has become
                  a model of Heritage Conservation in India.
                </p>

                <p  class="p-2">
                  Additionally, many more initiatives such as Watershed Development, Sheep and Wool
                  Development, Skill Development for Diamond Cutting and Polishing, Eradication of Child
                  Labour, Alternate Health & Family Welfare Services, Literacy & Primary Education,
                  Food and Nutrition programs have also been successfully implemented.

                  The journey that began in 1993–94 from Nawalgarh, a small town located on the edge
                  of the Thar Desert in Rajasthan, now serves over one million households through
                  Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES).
