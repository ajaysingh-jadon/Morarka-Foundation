              <ul>
                <li class="mb-3">Back in <strong>1994–95</strong>, only about 10% of farmland in Shekhawati (Nawalgarh Block, Jhunjhunu) was under irrigation. Although the <strong>water table was shallow</strong> and the <strong>State Electricity Board</strong> provided connections, farmers were hesitant due to <strong>undulating terrain and sandy soils</strong>. The high cost of leveling—₹1 to ₹1.5 lakhs per acre—was a major deterrent.</li>


              <li class="mb-3">
                After being awarded an <strong>Extension Services Project</strong> by the Department of Agriculture (GOR), Morarka Foundation introduced innovative technologies to over <strong>10,000 farm families across 25 villages</strong>. Among the most impactful was the <strong>Sprinkler Irrigation System</strong>.
              </li>

              <li class="mb-3">
                This system proved ideal for the region’s challenging conditions. It enabled effective irrigation on <strong>uneven, sandy land</strong> and delivered <strong>yields comparable to leveled fields</strong>—without the high cost of land leveling.
              </li>

              <li class="mb-3">
                The success led to a surge in demand for <strong>electrical connections</strong>, with wait times of up to 4–5 years. Still, farmers saw this as a gateway to prosperity.
              </li>

              <li class="mb-3">
                As irrigation improved, farmers began <strong>relocating to their fields</strong>, planting trees, and cultivating vegetables—initially for self-use, later for income. Many adopted <strong>integrated farming</strong> by rearing dairy animals, turning milk into ghee for commercial sale.
              </li>

              <li class="mb-3">
                In just a decade, irrigated land expanded to <strong>over 40%</strong>, with <strong>100% of it using sprinkler systems</strong>. This marks a remarkable transformation driven by innovation, community engagement, and sustained effort.
